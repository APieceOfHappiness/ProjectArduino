# Development of an Arduino device for collecting and analyzing environmental data

## Goal:
To figure out exactly how Arduino works, learn some new C/C++ libraries for 
prototyping electronics "Wiring", and eventually develop useful device for collecting and analizing data about environment(At least we do it for fun)

## Collecting data
We will collect the information with Arduino's sensors
For instance:
Sound sensor (tracking the level of noise)
Light sensor (For example, APDS-9930. It also is able to track the distance and movements that also may be useful for future analizis)
temperature sensor (for example, DS18B20) 
humidity sensor(will choose it later, for example DHT11)
We will also try to add oxygen sensor for checking the quality of oxygen, if we find a cheap one

## Analizis
The device is to connect to computer (we are not sure about the type of connection, It can be either a wire or a network) 
It will be necessary to write software that will process information and display all data collected from sensors (All sensors must be applyed), as well as visual information (graphs):

1) Some has to show a change in values relative to time (nessesary for sensors)
2) Some should show the dependencies of some quantities with each other
